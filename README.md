Are you looking forward to Cyclone? Got a 3D printer? Good! Show everyone what's up by printing your own Cyclone for your keychain! Both .stl and .blend folder are included. Hopefully you're better at 3D printing then I am and you'll have better results than I did!

Results can vary based on material, noozle size, temperture, etc.
